# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI (CLI-based)

This is my implementation of artificial intelligence using Minimax algorithm with Python.

To run the program, simply type 

```cmd
python src/main.py
```

in your command prompt. If you want the bot to start first, add ```-b``` flag in the command.

If you are interested in understanding what is Minimax algorithm, please refer to Sebastian Lague's video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&ab_channel=SebastianLague)
